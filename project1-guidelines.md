# Project #1 - The Game!

## The Goal üéØ

Create a game that combines your new **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** skills! This project is to be done in pairs, decided by you!

You'll need to send me a message on slack informing me of your group by next monday Oct 30!

## Important Dates üóìÔ∏è

### Pitch Presentation: 30-10-2023

The group will need to present at least 2 game ideas to the LT in order to decide which project you'll develop.

### Project Start: 01-11-2023

We officially begin our project development!

### MVP and Deploy: 11-11-2023

You'll present your MVP - Minimum Viable Product - to the LT and CTA. MVP means you should have a working game and everything you do after this point is adding **sugar**. After the MVPs we'll deploy the games together in order to have enough time to fix any problems that might appear after the deploy.

### Project Presentation: 15-11-2023

You'll present your game for everyone! At the end the class will vote on the projects in 4 categories: **Most Aesthetically Pleasing, Most Challenging Coding Wise, Most Original Idea**¬†and¬†**Best Overall!** More info on the presentation below.

## Project Weeks Schedule üë©‚Äçüíª

### Standups

We gather in circle and every group should answer the following questions:

1. What did I do last class (or the last time you worked on the project)
2. What will I do today
3. What are my blockers

### Project Development

We'll focus totally in developing the projects and the LT and the CTA will be here to help you! Every time you need help, you'll use the ticketing system from the #pt-web-help channel.
